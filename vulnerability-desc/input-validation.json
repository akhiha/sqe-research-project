	"title": "Improper Input Validation Vulnerability",
	"description": "The product receives input or data, but it does not validate or incorrectly validates that the input has the properties that are required to process the data safely and correctly. Input validation is a frequently used technique for checking potentially dangerous inputs in order to ensure that the inputs are safe for processing within the code, or when communicating with other components. When software does not validate input properly, an attacker is able to craft the input in a form that is not expected by the rest of the application. This will lead to parts of the system receiving unintended input, which may result in altered control flow, arbitrary control of a resource, or arbitrary code execution.",
	"analysis": "1. Identify Input Sources: Locate all entry points where user or external data is received (e.g., APIs, forms, query strings, file uploads). \n 2. Trace Data Flow: Follow the flow of input data through the system to understand how it interacts with different components. \n 3. Analyze Validation Logic: Ensure inputs are validated for expected properties such as: \n   a. Type: Is the input a string, integer, etc.? \n   b. Size/Length: Does the input fall within acceptable size or length ranges? \n   c. Format/Structure: Does the input match expected patterns or formats (e.g., email, UUID)? \n   d. Range: Is the value within allowed numerical or logical limits? \n 4. Check Domain-Specific Rules: Validate inputs against business logic rules, such as price limits or date ranges. \n 5. Verify Input Consistency: Ensure consistency between input fields (e.g., start date must be earlier than end date). \n 6. Inspect Edge Case Handling: Analyze how the system handles unexpected input values such as negative numbers, special characters, or empty inputs. \n 7. Review Error Handling: Ensure the application provides meaningful error messages without revealing sensitive information about internal logic. \n 8. Check for Redundant or Missing Validation: Ensure inputs are validated at all necessary stages (e.g., client-side, server-side, database). Avoid relying solely on client-side validation. \n 9. Inspect Input Transformation Logic: Ensure dangerous characters or tokens are properly escaped, encoded, or sanitized before further processing. \n 10. Evaluate Authentication and Ownership Checks: Confirm that inputs tied to specific users or sessions are authenticated and verified (e.g., using cryptographic signatures). \n 11. Test System Behavior with Malformed Inputs: Manually input various unexpected or malicious values (e.g., very long strings, special characters) and observe system behavior. \n 12. Check Logging and Monitoring: Ensure all invalid or malicious inputs are logged for auditing purposes without exposing sensitive data. \n 13. Static and Dynamic Code Analysis: Use tools to identify improper input validation practices in both the codebase and runtime."
