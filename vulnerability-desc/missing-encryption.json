	"title": "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data Vulnerability",
	"description": "The product does not encrypt sensitive or critical information before storage or transmission. The lack of proper data encryption passes up the guarantees of confidentiality, integrity, and accountability that properly implemented encryption conveys.",
	"analysis": "1. Identify Affected Components: Look for sensitive data (passwords, PII) transmitted or stored. \n 2. Analyze Data Flow: Trace data paths in system diagrams.\n 3. Inspect Security Mechanisms: \n 3.a Ensure HTTPS/TLS for all communications. \n 3.b Verify encryption in databases and file storage. \n 3.c Verify strong encryption algorithms to encrypt passwords before storing them in configuration files. \n 4. Check Configurations: Ensure SSL/TLS settings are enabled, and certificates are valid. \n 5. Threat Modeling: Map network and storage threats to identify interception points. \n 6. Usage of Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction to identify the vulnerability."
