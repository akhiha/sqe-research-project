	"title": "Missing Authorization Vulnerability",
	"description": "The product does not perform an authorization check when an actor attempts to access a resource or perform an action. Assuming a user with a given identity, authorization is the process of determining whether that user can access a given resource, based on the user's privileges and any permissions or other access-control specifications that apply to the resource. When access control checks are not applied, users are able to access data or perform actions that they should not be allowed to perform. This can lead to a wide range of problems, including information exposures, denial of service, and arbitrary code execution.",
	"analysis": "1. Identify Resources and Actions: Locate all sensitive resources (e.g., data, files, directories) and privileged actions (e.g., modify settings, perform administrative tasks) in the system. \n 2. Trace Access Control Implementation: Examine the flow of requests to these resources or actions. Ensure access control checks (e.g., role-based, attribute-based) are consistently applied. \n 3. Verify Role-Based Access Control (RBAC): Confirm that roles (anonymous, user, admin) are mapped correctly to their respective data and functionality. Ensure RBAC boundaries prevent unauthorized horizontal or vertical access. \n 4. Review Business Logic Access Controls: Validate that business logic-specific access control checks are implemented, e.g., patients can only view their medical records. \n 5. Server-Side Enforcement: Ensure all access control mechanisms are enforced server-side. Verify no sensitive functionality can be accessed via direct URL manipulation or bypassing client-side checks. \n 6. Test Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalation: Horizontal: Attempt to access resources or actions of another user with the same role. Vertical: Attempt to perform actions or access data that requires a higher privilege level. \n 7. Inspect Authentication and Session Management: Confirm that sensitive resources and pages are restricted to active, authenticated sessions. Ensure session tokens are associated with users who have the appropriate permissions. \n 8. Check Cache and Browser History Controls: Ensure pages with sensitive data are not cached by the client or proxy servers. Verify cache headers to prevent unauthorized access to cached content. \n 9. Audit Libraries and Frameworks: Ensure any access control libraries or frameworks (e.g., JAAS, OWASP ESAPI) are properly integrated and utilized. \n 10. Static Code Analysis: Use automated tools to identify missing authorization checks in the codebase. Focus on endpoints, database queries, and sensitive operations. \n 11. Dynamic Testing and Penetration Testing: Perform dynamic testing to simulate real-world attack scenarios. Use tools to identify endpoints that lack proper authorization checks. \n 12. Examine System Configuration: Review operating system and server environment access control lists (ACLs). Apply a 'default deny' policy to limit access by default. \n 13. Logging and Monitoring: Ensure unauthorized access attempts are logged. Regularly review logs to detect and respond to suspicious activities."
