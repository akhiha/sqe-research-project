	"title": "SQL Injection Vulnerability",
	"description": "The product constructs all or part of an SQL command using externally influenced input from an upstream component, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements that could modify the intended SQL command when it is sent to a downstream component. Without sufficient removal or quoting of SQL syntax in user-controllable inputs, the generated SQL query can cause those inputs to be interpreted as SQL instead of ordinary user data.",
	"analysis": "1. Identify Affected Components: Locate components that process user inputs and interact with the database. Focus on login handlers, search functionalities, and form inputs. \n 2. Analyze Data Flow: Trace user input from the frontend to SQL query execution. Identify instances of dynamic SQL query construction using user input. \n 3. Inspect Security Mechanisms: Verify the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements. Check for proper input sanitization and escaping. Ensure error messages do not expose query structures. \n 4. Validate Input Handling: Ensure client-side input validation is replicated on the server-side. Review server-side validation for constraints like length, format, and allowed characters. \n 5. Review Access Controls: Check if the database adheres to the Principle of Least Privilege. Validate permissions of database accounts, ensuring minimal privileges. Review stored procedure designs for robust input validation. \n 6. Threat Modeling: Identify entry points vulnerable to SQL injection. Simulate attacks using common injection payloads (e.g., '; DROP TABLE users; --). \n 7. Code and Configuration Review: Inspect dynamic SQL query construction for vulnerabilities. Ensure database configurations disable dangerous features (e.g., xp_cmdshell). \n 8. Test with Security Tools: Use static analysis tools to detect insecure SQL query patterns. Conduct dynamic testing with tools like SQLmap. Test the effectiveness of Web Application Firewalls (WAFs)."
