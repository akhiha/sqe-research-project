	"title": "Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) Vulnerability",
	"description": "The web server receives a URL or similar request from an upstream component and retrieves the contents of this URL, but it does not sufficiently ensure that the request is being sent to the expected destination. By providing URLs to unexpected hosts or ports, attackers can make it appear that the server is sending the request, possibly bypassing access controls such as firewalls that prevent the attackers from accessing the URLs directly. The server can be used as a proxy to conduct port scanning of hosts in internal networks, use other URLs such as that can access documents on the system (using file://), or use other protocols such as gopher:// or tftp://, which may provide greater control over the contents of requests.",
	"analysis": "1. Identify Entry Points: Locate all inputs where user-supplied URLs or similar requests are accepted (e.g., API endpoints, URL parameters, web forms). \n 2. Trace the Data Flow: Analyze how the application processes and uses the input URLs. Follow the flow from input (source) to the point where the request is executed (sink). \n 3. Check URL Validation Logic: Verify if the application has proper validation in place for URLs. Confirm that it rejects non-allowed schemes (e.g., file://, gopher://) and unexpected formats (octal, hexadecimal IPs). \n 4. Inspect Domain and IP Whitelisting: Ensure the application has a strict allowlist for permissible domains and IPs. Check if internal/private IP ranges (e.g., 127.0.0.1, 10.x.x.x) are appropriately blocked. \n 5. Review Redirection Handling: Analyze if the application follows redirects from user-supplied URLs. Validate if redirections to unauthorized or internal resources are prevented. \n 6. Test for Internal Resource Access: Manually craft URLs that target internal services or sensitive endpoints (e.g., http://localhost/admin, http://internal-api). Observe if the application fetches data from these resources. \n 7. Check Access to Non-HTTP Protocols: Attempt to supply URLs using non-HTTP protocols (e.g., file://, ftp://, gopher://) to see if the application handles them securely. \n 8. Analyze Error Messages: Review error messages for hints about internal infrastructure, such as internal IPs, server configurations, or file paths. \n 9. Inspect Logging and Monitoring: Ensure the application logs all URL requests for auditing. Verify logs for any abnormal or unauthorized access patterns. \n 10. Conduct Penetration Testing: Use automated tools to simulate SSRF attacks and identify any vulnerable endpoints. Perform manual testing to confirm tool findings and explore additional edge cases. \n 11. Review Server-Side Configuration: Ensure that server settings restrict outbound requests to internal resources. Apply network-level restrictions using firewalls and access control lists (ACLs). \n 12. Verify Remediation Mechanisms: Check if the application uses a URL parser library with robust validation features. Confirm that any implemented fixes prevent similar SSRF scenarios."
