The class diagram for "ShopEZ_Server" indicates a potential vulnerability concerning the "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data." Let's follow the analysis steps to determine if this vulnerability exists in the diagram.

**1. Identify Affected Components:**
- Sensitive data, such as the username and password, is transmitted when the user logs in.
- The cookie set by `ShopEZ_Server` potentially contains sensitive information since it is later used for authentication.

**2. Analyze Data Flow:**
- Data flows from `User` to `ShopEZ_Server` with the login credentials likely via the internet.
- `ShopEZ_Server` sets a cookie on the `Browser`, which indicates that information is transferred and stored on the client-side.
- The attacker employs XSS to steal cookies from the `Browser`, exploiting a lack of secure handling.

**3. Inspect Security Mechanisms:**
   - 3.a **Ensure HTTPS/TLS for all communications:** There is no explicit mention of HTTPS/TLS usage in the diagram for secure communication between components, especially during login and cookie transmission.
   - 3.b **Verify encryption in databases and file storage:** The diagram indicates the cookie with credentials is set in plaintext, suggesting no encryption, thus compromising confidentiality.
   - 3.c **Verify strong encryption algorithms to encrypt passwords before storing them in configuration files:** There is no evidence that passwords are encrypted either in storage or during transmission.

**4. Check Configurations:**
- The class diagram does not provide details on SSL/TLS configurations or certificate validity, which would mitigate data interception risks.

**5. Threat Modeling:**
- The diagram explicitly mentions an attacker exploiting a vulnerability to steal cookies through XSS and replay stolen credentials, indicating that thereâ€™s a possibility of intercepting sensitive data due to a lack of encryption.

**6. Usage of Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction:**
- The class diagram lacks formal methods or clear indications that data transmission has encryption, reinforcing concerns about the vulnerability.

**Conclusion:**
The class diagram exhibits a "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data" vulnerability, specifically where the `ShopEZ_Server` sets the cookie containing plaintext credentials. This lack of encryption allows an attacker to steal sensitive data (cookie) via XSS, leading to unauthorized access. This vulnerability is highlighted in the following part of the diagram:

```
ShopEZ_Server -> Browser: Set Cookie (Plaintext Credentials)
Browser -> Attacker: Attacker injects XSS payload
Attacker -> Browser: Steal Cookie via malicious script
Attacker -> ShopEZ_Server: Replay stolen credentials
```
