To determine if the Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data vulnerability exists in the class diagram, let's follow the specified analysis steps:

1. **Identify Affected Components:**
   - Sensitive data in this context includes the `password` attribute in the `User` class and possibly session data stored by the `CookieManager`.

2. **Analyze Data Flow:**
   - The `User` sends credentials to the `ShopEZ_Server` which includes the `username` and `password`. 
   - `ShopEZ_Server` communicates with `CookieManager` to store session data, and `CookieManager` sets the session data as a cookie in the `Browser`.

3. **Inspect Security Mechanisms:**
   - **3.a:** There is no explicit mention of HTTPS/TLS for user authentication or data transmission between components.
   - **3.b:** There is no indication of data encryption in storage or transmission.
   - **3.c:** No details suggest that passwords are encrypted before storage, nor is there mention of strong encryption algorithms for storing cookies.

4. **Check Configurations:**
   - There is no information on SSL/TLS settings or certificate usage in the class diagram.

5. **Threat Modeling:**
   - The data flow shows potential interception points, especially when `Browser` leaks cookies to `Attacker`, suggesting a lack of encryption.

6. **Usage of Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction:**
   - Not applicable based on the class diagram alone, but existing data flows indicate opportunities for data interception.

Based on the above analysis, the **Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data** vulnerability is present in the class diagram. This vulnerability exists in the following parts:

- In the `User` class, where the `password` may not be encrypted during transmission to `ShopEZ_Server`.
- In the `CookieManager`, the absence of encryption methods for cookies being set and stored in the `Browser` indicates a lack of data encryption.

These areas suggest weaknesses in the protection of sensitive data, aligning with the described vulnerability.
