To determine if the specified vulnerability ("Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data") exists within the class diagram, let's follow the analysis steps outlined:

1. **Identify Affected Components:**  
   In the class diagram, the sensitive data identified is the password. The `LoginHandler` class handles `username` and `password`, which are clearly sensitive data.

2. **Analyze Data Flow:**  
   The data flow for sensitive information can be traced through the following path:
   - `LoginHandler` is responsible for authenticating users and requires both `username` and `password`.
   - `SQLQueryBuilder` builds a query using both `username` and `password`.
   - `DatabaseExecutor` then executes the query against the `UsersTable`.

3. **Inspect Security Mechanisms:**  
   3.a: There is no mention of HTTPS/TLS for communication in the class diagram.  
   3.b: There is no indication of encryption for data stored in the `UsersTable`.  
   3.c: There is no evidence of any strong encryption algorithms being applied to `password` before building the query or storage.

4. **Check Configurations:**  
   The class diagram does not provide information regarding SSL/TLS settings or certificate validation.

5. **Threat Modeling:**  
   Without encryption, the password could be intercepted or improperly stored, making it accessible to unauthorized users.

6. **Usage of Formal Methods / Correct-By-Construction:**  
   There's no indication of formal methods being employed for ensuring encryption.

### Conclusion
The class diagram contains the "Missing Encryption of Sensitive Data" vulnerability. The vulnerability exists because the `password` is used in `LoginHandler`, `SQLQueryBuilder`, and potentially stored or transmitted without encryption. Specifically, the flow between these components does not show any encryption when handling passwords.
