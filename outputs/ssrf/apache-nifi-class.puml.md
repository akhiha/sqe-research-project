Based on the provided class diagram, let's conduct the analysis steps to check for the presence of a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability:

1. **Identify Entry Points**: The class diagram does not explicitly show any entry points where user-supplied URLs or similar requests are accepted. The `Application` class has methods like `connectToDatabase()`, but there is no indication of URL parameters or API endpoints being used by untrusted input.

2. **Trace the Data Flow**: There is no clear indication that any class or method receives, processes, or executes input URLs coming from users or external systems. The `establishConnection` method in `DatabaseConnector` takes a URL, but it seems designed to use configuration files rather than user input.

3. **Check URL Validation Logic**: Since there is no user-supplied URL input logic shown in the class diagram, validation logic for URLs is not present.

4. **Inspect Domain and IP Whitelisting**: No whitelisting or related security logic is indicated in the class diagram.

5. **Review Redirection Handling**: The class diagram does not demonstrate any URL processing or redirection handling.

6. **Test for Internal Resource Access**: Without user-supplied inputs in the diagram, there is no opportunity to test URL inputs for unauthorized access.

7. **Check Access to Non-HTTP Protocols**: The diagram does not indicate that the application handles different protocols based on user inputs.

8. **Analyze Error Messages**: This aspect is not represented in the class diagram.

9. **Inspect Logging and Monitoring**: There is no mention of logging or monitoring within the class diagram.

10. **Conduct Penetration Testing**: This cannot be deduced from a class diagram perspective.

11. **Review Server-Side Configuration**: Such configuration details are not present in the class diagram.

12. **Verify Remediation Mechanisms**: No URL parser libraries or remediation mechanisms are displayed in the diagram.

Based on the analysis, there is no evidence of a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability present in the given class diagram. The diagram focuses more on application, configuration, and database connection management, without user-driven URL processing that would typically lead to an SSRF condition.

**Conclusion**: "Vulnerability not Found"
