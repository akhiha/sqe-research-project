Based on the provided class diagram and the analysis steps, let's identify if a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists.

**Analysis:**

1. **Identify Entry Points:** 
   - The class diagram shows interaction between `User`, `ShopEZ_Server`, `CookieManager`, `Browser`, and `Attacker`, but there is no explicit reference to accepting user-supplied URLs or similar entries in any of the classes. 

2. **Trace the Data Flow:**
   - The data flow in the diagram pertains to the authentication process and handling cookie data. There is no depiction of processing URLs or handling web requests that might lead to SSRF.

3. **Check URL Validation Logic:**
   - No classes or methods in the diagram indicate URL processing or validation functionality.

4. **Inspect Domain and IP Whitelisting:**
   - There's no mention of domain/IP filtering or whitelisting mechanisms.

5. **Review Redirection Handling:**
   - The diagram does not include any logic or classes for handling URL redirects.

6. **Test for Internal Resource Access:**
   - Since no URL processing or request methods are present, testing for internal resources access is irrelevant in the given context.

7. **Check Access to Non-HTTP Protocols:**
   - There's no indication of handling non-HTTP protocols in any of the classes.

8. **Analyze Error Messages, Logging, and Monitoring:**
   - The class diagram does not specify error handling, logging, or monitoring mechanisms related to URL requests.

9. **Conduct Penetration Testing & Review Server-Side Configuration:**
   - This cannot be assessed within the class diagram context.

10. **Verify Remediation Mechanisms:**
    - The class diagram provides no evidence of URL parsing libraries or SSRF mitigation logic.

Based on the class diagram and the steps followed for analyzing an SSRF vulnerability, there is no explicit indication of potential SSRF vulnerabilities present. The diagram primarily focuses on user authentication and cookie handling processes.

**Conclusion:** Vulnerability not Found.
