Based on the provided class diagram and the description of Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerabilities, let's analyze the potential existence of such a vulnerability in the system depicted in the class diagram by following the analysis steps mentioned:

1. **Identify Entry Points**: The class diagram doesn't explicitly show any entry points where user-supplied URLs or similar requests are accepted. The methods in the classes like `canFlush`, `shutdownServer`, and `setSystemConfig` do not indicate accepting URL inputs.

2. **Trace the Data Flow**: From the diagram, there is no indication of data flow involving URLs being processed or URL-based operations.

3. **Check URL Validation Logic**: The diagram does not detail any URL handling or validation logic, nor does it show any processing of external URLs.

4. **Inspect Domain and IP Whitelisting**: There is no evidence in the class diagram of domain or IP whitelisting mechanisms related to URL handling.

5. **Review Redirection Handling**: The class diagram does not suggest any URL redirection logic or the handling thereof.

6. **Test for Internal Resource Access**: There is no indication that the application fetches data from user-supplied URLs that could be targeting internal resources.

7. **Check Access to Non-HTTP Protocols**: The class diagram does not imply the application uses non-HTTP protocols or processes such input from URLs.

8. **Analyze Error Messages and Logging**: There are no details about error handling logic or logging related to URL requests in the diagram.

9. **Inspect Logging and Monitoring**: The class diagram omits information about URL request auditing or monitoring.

10. **Conduct Penetration Testing**: The diagram does not provide information on tool-based testing capabilities or any manual testing approaches concerning URLs.

11. **Review Server-Side Configuration**: Information about server-side or network-level configurations to restrict URL requests is not present in the diagram.

12. **Verify Remediation Mechanisms**: No information is visible about remediation mechanisms or usage of URL parsers for validation based on the diagram.

Given that the provided class diagram does not demonstrate any URL handling or user-supplied URL processing across its classes, it doesn't seem to contain evidence for a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability according to the specified analysis. Therefore, the result is:

**Vulnerability not Found**
