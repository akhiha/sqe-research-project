Based on the provided class diagram and the outlined analysis steps for identifying an SSRF vulnerability, let's go through the steps:

1. **Identify Entry Points**: In the given diagram, the entry point for user-supplied input is the `LoginHandler` class, which takes `username` and `password` as input parameters for the `AuthenticateUser` method. These parameters are not typical for an SSRF vulnerability, as SSRF usually involves URLs or similar constructs.

2. **Trace the Data Flow**: The data flow in the diagram is from `LoginHandler` to `SQLQueryBuilder` to `DatabaseExecutor`, ultimately querying the `UsersTable`. The inputs do not appear to involve URL handling or the construction of network requests to be executed server-side.

3. **Check URL Validation Logic**: The context of the classes and methods provided does not indicate any URL processing or validation logic. The primary focus is on authentication and database query execution.

4. **Inspect Domain and IP Whitelisting**: There is no indication that this system handles URLs or that there are any mechanisms for enforcing domain or IP whitelisting.

5. **Review Redirection Handling**: No redirection handling is mentioned or implied in the class responsibilities or data flow.

6. **Test for Internal Resource Access**: As there are no URLs being processed or executed, there's no pathway for internal resource access via SSRF.

7. **Check Access to Non-HTTP Protocols**: There is no indication that any non-HTTP protocols are employed or can be invoked from the class diagram.

8. **Analyze Error Messages**: Since there's no request being made to external or user-defined URLs, analyzing error messages for SSRF-related information is not applicable.

9. **Inspect Logging and Monitoring**: The class diagram does not provide information about logging URL requests or any abnormal access patterns.

10. **Conduct Penetration Testing**: The diagram does not suggest any SSRF entry points to test against, as it primarily handles database interactions.

11. **Review Server-Side Configuration**: The configuration details regarding server-side outbound requests or network-level restrictions are not covered in this diagram.

12. **Verify Remediation Mechanisms**: The diagram does not describe the use of URL parser libraries or SSRF mitigation measures, largely because URL handling is not depicted.

Based on these analyses, the provided class diagram does not show any indication of an SSRF vulnerability. There is no handling of URLs or external requests where SSRF could be a concern. Therefore, the conclusion is:

**Vulnerability not Found**
