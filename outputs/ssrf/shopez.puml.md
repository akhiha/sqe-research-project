Based on the class diagram provided, let's follow the analysis steps to determine if a Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF) vulnerability exists:

1. **Identify Entry Points**: The diagram does not specifically mention any entry points where user-supplied URLs or similar requests are accepted. The interactions focus on login, cookie setting, and replaying credentials.

2. **Trace the Data Flow**: The primary focus of the data flow in the diagram is on user authentication and the mishandling of cookies, rather than processing URLs to perform backend requests on external or internal resources.

3. **Check URL Validation Logic**: There is no indication in the diagram of logic that processes and validates URLs, thereby preventing SSRF-related schemes or formats.

4. **Inspect Domain and IP Whitelisting**: The diagram does not provide information on domain or IP whitelisting. It primarily deals with cookie handling and authentication flow.

5. **Review Redirection Handling**: The diagram does not include details involving URL redirection handling.

6. **Test for Internal Resource Access**: Not applicable, as there are no indications of URL handling mechanisms.

7. **Check Access to Non-HTTP Protocols**: No mention is made of the application handling URLs with non-HTTP protocols.

8. **Analyze Error Messages**: The diagram does not convey any error message flows related to URL handling.

9. **Inspect Logging and Monitoring**: There is no reference to logging or monitoring URL requests.

10. **Conduct Penetration Testing**: The diagram is a high-level interaction flow and doesn't cover penetration testing results or implications related to SSRF.

11. **Review Server-Side Configuration**: Nothing in the diagram suggests that the server could be misconfigured to facilitate SSRF.

12. **Verify Remediation Mechanisms**: There are no clear mechanisms depicted in the diagram that pertain to SSRF prevention or remediation.

Based on this analysis, the class diagram provided mainly illustrates an issue related to insecure cookie handling resulting in unauthorized access (potentially indicative of a cross-site scripting vulnerability). It does not contain the SSRF vulnerability as described in the provided vulnerability specification. Therefore, the conclusion is:
  
**"Vulnerability not Found."**
