Let's analyze the provided class diagram using the steps mentioned to determine if the Improper Input Validation Vulnerability is present.

1. **Identify Input Sources**:  
   - The main input source identified in the diagram is the "Login with Username & Password" action where the `User` interacts with the `ShopEZ_Server`.

2. **Trace Data Flow**:  
   - The user credentials flow from the `User` to the `ShopEZ_Server`.
   - The system then sets a cookie with plaintext credentials in the `Browser`.

3. **Analyze Validation Logic**:
   - The diagram doesn’t explicitly show any validation logic for the inputs. This analysis pertains primarily to improper input validation of the payload injected by the `Attacker`.

4. **Check Domain-Specific Rules**:  
   - No domain-specific validation logic is depicted at this interaction level.

5. **Verify Input Consistency**:  
   - There is no explicit verification for input consistency shown.

6. **Inspect Edge Case Handling**:  
   - The diagram does not provide information on how edge cases are handled for login or other inputs.

7. **Review Error Handling**:  
   - There is no depiction of error handling in the diagram showing how the system reacts to incorrect inputs.

8. **Check for Redundant or Missing Validation**:  
   - The diagram illustrates a critical security issue, where credentials are stored as plaintext cookies without validation of proper encoding or structure, which is not directly an input validation issue but related to how secure the cookie storage is.
   - There is no validation shown for the XSS payload injected by the `Attacker`.

9. **Inspect Input Transformation Logic**:  
   - The lack of transformation or securing of the cookies before storage indicates potential vulnerability to input-related attacks, even though not specifically improper input validation.

10. **Evaluate Authentication and Ownership Checks**:  
   - Server-side cookie validation should happen, which seems compromised here as the attacker can replay the stolen credentials.

11. **Test System Behavior with Malformed Inputs**:  
   - The diagram doesn't provide specific data about how malformed inputs are tested or handled.

12. **Check Logging and Monitoring**:  
   - Monitoring and logging mechanisms for input validation aren’t covered in the diagram.

13. **Static and Dynamic Code Analysis**:  
   - Code analysis isn’t depicted in the UML diagram.

Upon applying the analysis steps, the specific vulnerability related to "Improper Input Validation" is not explicitly shown in the diagram. However, the diagram does indicate other serious issues, namely risks related to cookie management and XSS injection, which may result partially from improper validation or handling of inputs. But according to your description, these are separate from the specific vulnerability of "Improper Input Validation." 

Therefore, based on the provided analysis and solely focusing on the improper input validation aspect:

**Vulnerability not Found**
