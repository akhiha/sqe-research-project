Based on the provided class diagram and the analysis steps for detecting SQL Injection vulnerabilities, let's examine the components step-by-step:

1. **Identify Affected Components:** 
   - The class `UserInputHandler` processes user input and interacts indirectly with the database through `SQLQueryBuilder` and `DatabaseExecutor`.
   - `SQLQueryBuilder` constructs SQL queries based on inputs received.
   - `DatabaseExecutor` executes these queries on the database, specifically the `UsersTable`.

2. **Analyze Data Flow:** 
   - The flow of data starts from `UserInputHandler`, where its method `processRequest(id: String)` likely receives user input.
   - This input is forwarded to `SQLQueryBuilder` using the `buildQuery(id: String): String` method, where the SQL query is constructed.
   - The constructed query is then executed by `DatabaseExecutor` with the `executeQuery(query: String)` method, targeting the `UsersTable`.

3. **Inspect Security Mechanisms:**
   - The class diagram does not provide details regarding the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements in `SQLQueryBuilder`.
   - Without explicit mention or mechanism for parameterizing queries and sanitizing inputs, the construction of dynamic SQL queries in `SQLQueryBuilder` presents a potential vulnerability.

4. **Validate Input Handling:**
   - There is no evidence in the class diagram that input validation or sanitization is being performed in `UserInputHandler` or elsewhere.

5. **Review Access Controls:**
   - The class diagram does not offer details about access controls for database interactions or user roles, so this cannot be evaluated.

6. **Threat Modeling:**
   - The entry point `processRequest(id: String)` is potentially vulnerable as it directly influences the SQL query via `buildQuery(id: String)` method in `SQLQueryBuilder`.

7. **Code and Configuration Review:**
   - As with previous steps, the class diagram lacks details on the internal logic for constructing SQL queries, particularly concerning sanitization and secure construction.

8. **Test with Security Tools:**
   - The diagram alone doesnâ€™t allow for practical testing, but the absence of security measures noted in the previous steps suggests that a closer review would be warranted.

Given this analysis, it is reasonable to conclude that the class diagram contains an SQL Injection vulnerability, specifically within the `SQLQueryBuilder` where user input is used to build SQL queries without evident safeguards like input sanitization or parameterization.
