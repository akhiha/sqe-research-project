Based on the class diagram provided, let's conduct an analysis to determine if there is an SQL Injection vulnerability:

1. **Identify Affected Components:**
   - The `Application` class through the `connectToDatabase()` method interacts with the `DatabaseConnector`. 
   - The `DatabaseConnector` has a method `establishConnection(url: String, username: String, password: String)` that likely interacts with the database.

2. **Analyze Data Flow:**
   - The class diagram does not explicitly show user inputs or form data being used for constructing SQL queries. There is no depiction of dynamic SQL query construction using user inputs.

3. **Inspect Security Mechanisms:**
   - There is no information in the diagram about the use of parameterized queries or prepared statements within the `DatabaseConnector` class. 
   - Since there is no SQL query depicted or method that shows query concatenation or execution, we cannot judge input sanitization or escaping.

4. **Validate Input Handling:**
   - There is a lack of detail on client-side or server-side input validation in this diagram.

5. **Review Access Controls:**
   - Details on database permissions or adherence to the Principle of Least Privilege are not available in the diagram. No mention of stored procedures or their input validations is present.

6. **Threat Modeling:**
   - The diagram does not provide explicit entry points for direct SQL injection attacks as would be indicated by user-to-database interactions.

7. **Code and Configuration Review:**
   - The diagram does not detail the construction of SQL queries, so there's no static connection here to examine for SQL injection-specific flaws.

8. **Test with Security Tools:**
   - The class diagram alone is insufficient to conduct such testing.

**Conclusion:**
The provided class diagram does not contain details sufficient to identify an SQL Injection vulnerability. It does not show any dynamic SQL query construction processes or direct user input channels that interface with SQL query operations. In practice, a code review would be necessary to confirm this, as the class diagram alone lacks the detail needed to uncover SQL injection risks. Therefore, based on the class diagram:

**Vulnerability not Found**
