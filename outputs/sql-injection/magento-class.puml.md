From the provided class diagram and following the analysis steps, let's determine if the SQL Injection vulnerability exists:

1. **Identify Affected Components**: 
   - The `AdminUser` class allows uploading a configuration archive via the `uploadConfigurationArchive(file)` method.
   - The `ConfigurationArchive` class has methods that could interact with the system, such as `extract()`. However, there is no explicit indication of interaction with a database.

2. **Analyze Data Flow**: 
   - There is no obvious indication in the diagram that user input is involved in constructing dynamic SQL queries. The diagram focuses on file upload and extraction rather than direct interaction with a database through SQL queries. 

3. **Inspect Security Mechanisms**: 
   - There is no information about the use of SQL queries, parameterized queries, or prepared statements mentioned in the class diagram.

4. **Validate Input Handling**: 
   - The diagram does not provide details about input validation or any form inputs that could be subject to SQL injection.

5. **Review Access Controls**: 
   - Access control-related details, like database permissions or roles, are not depicted in the class diagram.

6. **Threat Modeling**: 
   - The `uploadConfigurationArchive(file)` method could potentially introduce vulnerabilities if it improperly handles user inputs, but without specific SQL query involvement, SQL Injection is unlikely based on the provided information.

7. **Code and Configuration Review**: 
   - The class diagram does not show any SQL query construction logic.

8. **Test with Security Tools**: 
   - Without further information on how the application constructs and executes SQL queries, it's not possible to use static or dynamic analysis to detect such patterns in a class diagram alone.

Based on the provided class diagram and analysis, the SQL Injection vulnerability does not appear to be explicitly represented. Without additional details showing user inputs directly influencing SQL query construction, there is no evidence of this specific vulnerability within the current class diagram.

**Conclusion**: Vulnerability not Found.
