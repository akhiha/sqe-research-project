Based on the provided class diagram and description of the vulnerability, we need to assess whether a missing authorization vulnerability exists in this system by following the analysis steps provided. Here's the breakdown:

1. **Identify Resources and Actions:**  
   - The primary sensitive resources and actions identified in the class diagram are:
     - The `ConfigurationArchive`, which stores a file and executes something on the system.
     - The `AdminUser` class, which has the ability to upload the configuration archive file.
  
2. **Trace Access Control Implementation:**  
   - The diagram does not provide any details about access control checks being applied. There is no indication of mechanisms like role-based access control associated with the `uploadConfigurationArchive` method or the `ConfigurationArchive` execution.

3. **Verify Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
   - The diagram does not show any roles or access control logic. It simply defines the ability for `AdminUser` to upload and a direct execution of `ConfigurationArchive`.

4. **Review Business Logic Access Controls:**  
   - There is no explicit business logic or access control logic relating to who can upload or execute certain actions.

5. **Server-Side Enforcement:**  
   - The diagram lacks details on server-side enforcement of any access control checks.

6. **Test Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalation:**  
   - Again, the diagram lacks the detail needed to perform such analysis, particularly the lack of roles and permissions.

7. **Inspect Authentication and Session Management:**  
   - No information on authentication or session management processes is provided.

8. **Check Cache and Browser History Controls:** 
   - This does not apply based on the provided class diagram.

9. **Audit Libraries and Frameworks:**  
   - There is no mention of any libraries or frameworks handling authorization in the diagram.

10. **Static Code Analysis:**  
    - Without the actual code, this analysis cannot be performed.

11. **Dynamic Testing and Penetration Testing:**  
    - These require a functional system to test against.

12. **Examine System Configuration:**  
    - The diagram lacks details regarding system configuration and access control lists.

13. **Logging and Monitoring:**  
    - There is no information on logging or monitoring access attempts.

### Conclusion:
The class diagram suggests a potential missing authorization vulnerability, primarily because it does not show any access control checks or authorization logic that would prevent unauthorized users from uploading or executing the `ConfigurationArchive`. The `uploadConfigurationArchive` method in the `AdminUser` class, and the execution link from `ConfigurationArchive` to `System`, are the areas where this vulnerability could exist due to missing authorization checks.

Therefore, I would highlight the `uploadConfigurationArchive` method in the `AdminUser` class and the execution connection of `ConfigurationArchive` to `System` as vulnerable to missing authorization checks. This conclusion follows from the absence of any information about authorization and access control checks being implemented in the system design as per the provided diagram.
