Based on the provided class diagram and using the analysis steps, we can determine whether there is a "Missing Authorization Vulnerability" present in the system:

1. **Identify Resources and Actions:**  
   - The sensitive resource in this diagram seems to be the `UsersTable`, which contains usernames and passwords.
   - The primary actions are authenticating a user (`AuthenticateUser`) and executing queries on the database (`ExecuteQuery`).

2. **Trace Access Control Implementation:**  
   - The flow of requests in the diagram is: `LoginHandler` -> `SQLQueryBuilder` -> `DatabaseExecutor` -> `UsersTable`.
   - There is no information in the diagram about any access control checks being applied at any point in this flow.

3. **Verify Role-Based Access Control (RBAC):**  
   - The diagram does not include any roles (such as user roles, admin roles) or any access control based on those roles.

4. **Review Business Logic Access Controls:**  
   - There are no business logic-specific access control checks evident from the diagram.

5. **Server-Side Enforcement:**  
   - No server-side access control mechanisms are depicted or mentioned in the provided diagram.

6. **Test Horizontal and Vertical Privilege Escalation:**  
   - The diagram lacks details about any mechanisms to prevent horizontal or vertical privilege escalation.

7. **Inspect Authentication and Session Management:**  
   - While the `AuthenticateUser` operation exists, there is no information about session management or restrictions on resources based on authentication.

8. **Check Cache and Browser History Controls:**  
   - There is no mention of caching controls within this diagram.

9. **Audit Libraries and Frameworks:**  
   - No specific access control libraries or frameworks are shown.

10. **Static Code Analysis:**  
    - Static analysis of the code cannot be performed here, but based on the diagram, no authorization checks are shown.

11. **Dynamic Testing and Penetration Testing:**  
    - Not applicable from the diagram alone.

12. **Examine System Configuration:**  
    - System configuration is not represented in the diagram.

13. **Logging and Monitoring:**  
   - The diagram does not cover logging or monitoring mechanisms.

**Conclusion:**

The class diagram indeed appears to lack any explicit authorization mechanisms. The sequence of operations (AuthenticateUser -> BuildQuery -> ExecuteQuery) does not show any form of authorization checks after a user is authenticated. This implies that once authenticated, no further checks occur to verify if the user has the right privileges to access the `UsersTable` or any specific data within it. 

Therefore, based on the provided information, this indicates the presence of a "Missing Authorization Vulnerability" especially around the `AuthenticateUser` and `ExecuteQuery` functions, as they do not incorporate role-based or privilege-based access control checks.
